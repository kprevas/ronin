Ronin is a strongly typed MVC web framework for the Gosu programming language. It includes (but can be used independently of) RoninDB, a Gosu-based object-relational mapping layer.

## Ronin
Ronin is a Model/View/Controller-based web framework featuring full type safety. Links between pages in a Ronin application are checked at compile-time, which means no broken links - by using a modern IDE like Eclipse, you can catch configuration errors and regressions right away, saving you valuable testing and debugging time. And configuring a Ronin application is done purely with Gosu code - no magic and no XML files, which makes debugging easier.

## RoninDB
RoninDB is a zero-configuration object-relational mapping layer, allowing you to query and update SQL databases using an intuitive object-oriented model. It uses Gosu's open type system to generate Gosu types based on your existing database schema, so there's no configuration required - your tables and columns become Gosu objects and properties automatically.
