    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Why Ronin?</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Imagine you're developing a web application with a typical web framework. You've noticed a bug on some page of
      your app... how do you fix it? Maybe you'll look for some distinctive text on the page, then search for that text
      in your project using your favorite IDE. Say the text turns up a template which was used to generate the page.</p>

    <p>Now you have to track down the data that was used to render the template, which means you need to find the code
      that retrieved the data, and maybe an XML configuration file which specifies how that data was mapped to an
      identifier used in the template. If you're not intimately familiar with the inner workings of the app, and of the
      framework you're using, you've got a lot of searching to do.</p>

    <p>With Ronin, everything is out in the open - there's almost no reflective magic or arcane XML files. The URL in
      your browser tells you which method on which class was called to generate the current page. That method contains a
      call to render the template for the page, and an explicit set of parameters providing the data for the template.
      If you're using IntelliJ, you can navigate between all these different pieces with a single click.</p>

    <p>And best of all, should you make a mistake - misspell a file name, or leave out a parameter - there will be a
      compilation error, so you'll know right away instead of having to exhaustively walk through your app (or maintain
      100% unit test coverage).</p>

  </section>

  <section id="getting_started">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Here's what you need to get started with Ronin:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Java 6 or later.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vark/Aardvark/downloads">Aardvark</a>, a build system for Gosu. Version 0.4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With aardvark on your path, you can run the remote Ronin installation script:</p>

        <pre>
  $ vark -f http://ronin-web.org/init.vark init -name <em>my_app</em></pre>

    <p>Where <em>my_app</em> is whatever name you would like for your Ronin application. You will see output like this:
    </p>
        <pre>
Buildfile: /private/var/folders/yy/1h6qk8t52rjczystgf79s5nm0000gn/T/build6584956297061779085.vark

    [unzip] Expanding: /var/folders/yy/1h6qk8t52/T/ronin-template8153128738706862212zip into ./my_app
     [echo] Created a new ronin application at ./my_app.
     [echo]   To start your ronin app, cd my_app; vark server

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds</pre>

    <p>Great, you've got a Ronin application set up. Let's look at how it is laid out:</p>
  </section>

  <section id="app_layout">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Ronin Application Layout</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Ronin applications are laid out in a very simple manner:</p>

    <div style="padding:16px">
      <dl>
        <dt>/build.vark</dt>
        <dd>This is the <a href="http://vark.github.com/">Aardvark</a> file for your project, and can be used for build
          scripting
        </dd>

        <dt>/pom.xml</dt>
        <dd>This is the dependency file for your Ronin application. Ronin does not use Maven for building, but leverages
          it for dependencies and IDE support.
        </dd>

        <dt>/src</dt>
        <dd>This is where all your source will go
          <dl>
            <dt>/src/config/RoninConfig.js</dt>
            <dd>This Gosu class allows you to configure the Ronin application</dd>

            <dt>/src/controller</dt>
            <dd>This is where your Ronin controllers will go</dd>

            <dt>/src/view</dt>
            <dd>This is where your Gosu templates will go (if you are using templates for your UI)</dd>

            <dt>/src/db</dt>
            <dd>This is where your .ddl and .sql files will go (if you are using Tosa to connect to a SQL database)</dd>
          </dl>

        </dd>

        <dt>/test</dt>
        <dd>This is where all your tests will go</dd>

        <dt>/html</dt>
        <dd>This is the root of the Ronin WAR file
          <dl>
            <dt>/html/WEB-INF/web.xml</dt>
            <dd>This is a thin web.xml file that bootstraps Ronin and Gosu in standard server environments.</dd>

            <dt>/html/public</dt>
            <dd>This folder can be used for static resources</dd>
          </dl>

        </dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

    <p>Note that there is very little configuration, besides dependencies in the <code>pom.xml</code> file. Ronin biases
      towards source code and away from configuration files, leveraging Gosu's flexible syntax and Open Type System.
      This makes things obvious and debuggable.</p>
  </section>


  <section id="starting_up">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Starting The Dev Server</h1>
    </div>

    <p>As the installation script says, you can change into your applications main directory and start up the built in
      webserver (Jetty):</p>

        <pre>
  $ cd my_app
  $ vark server
  1 [main] INFO Ronin - Environment properties are: {}
	1 [main] WARN Ronin - The DCEVM not available, Ronin will use classloaders for hotswapping

  11325 [main] INFO Ronin - 
  11325 [main] INFO Ronin - Your Ronin App is listening at http://localhost:8080
        </pre>

    <p>At this point, you should be able to see your application at <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="hello_world">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>

    <p>So now you've got a server running, but it's not necessarily doing anything interesting. If you try to access it
      from your browser, you'll get a placeholder page.</p>

    <p>In Ronin, there are generally two components involved in responding to a user's request: a controller and a view.
      The controller will perform any necessary actions, and then will delegate to a view, which will create the HTML
      (or other response) that is sent back to the user's browser.</p>

    <h2>Creating A Controller</h2>

    <p>Let's create the simplest possible controller. A Ronin controller is defined via a Gosu class. Classes
      in Gosu are very similar to classes in Java; they are defined in their own file, and the name of the file (plus
      the directory in which it lives) determines the name of the class. Ronin has a special rule that controller
      classes must live in the "controller" package (<code>my_app/src/controller</code>). Since our goal is to create a
      blogging application, let's create a controller class which will eventually contain all of the code for viewing
      and manipulating blog posts.</p>

    <p>Add create and add the following code in the <code>src/controller/PostCx.gs</code> file:</p>
						
						<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  package controller

  uses ronin.RoninController

  class PostCx extends RoninController {

  }</pre>

    <p>Let's take a moment to examine the anatomy of this class. The <code>package</code> statement simply restates
      which package this class lives in. The <code>uses</code> statement identifies a class in another package which we
      want to reference in this class; this is the equivalent of <code>import</code> in Java. Finally, the
      <code>class</code> statement restates the name of the class, and identifies its superclass.</p>

    <p>Note that unlike a Java import statement, the uses statement doesn't end in a semicolon. Ending statements with a
      semicolon is not required in Gosu (though it is permitted).</p>

    <p>When I tell you later on to add a uses statement to this class, add it after the existing uses statement and
      before the class statement.</p>

    <p>Throughout this tutorial, we'll be using a convention where controller classes have names ending in "Cx" (short
      for "Controller"). In general you may name a controller class however you like.</p>

    <p>Now let's add a function to this class. Each function on the controller class will be responsible for responding
      to requests from a single URL.</p>

    <p>Add this code to your class:</p>
         
											<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function viewPost() : String {
	  return "&lt;html>&lt;body>This is a post&lt;/body>&lt;/html>"
  }</pre>
    <p>Gosu functions are defined using the <code>function</code> keyword. They have public access by default, and are
      assumed to have a void return value unless specified otherwise. This method returns a
      <code>java.lang.String</code></p>

    <p>This is the simplest possible controller method: it does not even delegate to a view. Instead, it simply returns
      a string value directly.  Now that you have created a controller function, you can invoke it by simply navigating
      to:</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/PostCx/viewPost">http://localhost:8080/PostCx/viewPost</a></p>
    
    <p>While returning strings directly like this can be handy, it is much more common to use a Gosu Template as a view. Let's look at
      how to do that.</p>

    <h2>Creating a View</h2>

    <p>Create the following file in <code>src/view/ViewPost</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;html>
  &lt;body>
    This is a post.
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>
    <p> A Gosu template is a special kind of Gosu file (with the extension .gst) which mixes plain text with Gosu code to
      produce the desired output (somewhat like a JSP). Ronin does not require that views live in the "view" package,
      but it is the conventional place to put them.</p>
    <p>Note that templates are part of Gosu, and are not specific to Ronin.</p>

    <p>The first line of this template is a template directive, as it is surrounded by <%@ and %>. The extends directive
      defines a "superclass" for this template; this isn't a true superclass in terms of inheritance, but it allows the
      template to call static methods on the given class without qualifying them. In this case, we're extending
      RoninTemplate, which contains some useful methods for Ronin templates.</p>

    <p>Now let's use this view template, rather than returning a string.  Change the code in <code>viewPost()</code> to this:</p>
											<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function viewPost() {
    view.ViewPost.render(Writer)
  }</pre>

    <p>Note that the method now does not declare a return type, making it void. Rather than returning a value, all
      response writing is delegated to the <code>ViewPost</code> template,
      by passing the <code>Writer</code> Property along to it. (<code>Writer</code> is a property available on
      all controllers</p>


    <h2>Using Gosu code in templates</h2>

    <p>Let's make this template slightly more interesting. Modify ViewPost.gst as follows:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;% uses java.util.Date %>
&lt;html>
  &lt;body>
    The current time is ${new Date()}.
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

    <p>There are two new types of template tags here. The first is surrounded by <% and %>; note that there is no @ like
      in the directive tags. This type of tag contains Gosu code which is executed as soon as the template encounters
      it; here, we're using it to add a uses statement. The tag will not be present in the output text.</p>

    <p>The second is surrounded by ${ and }. This type of tag contains Gosu code which evaluates to a value; that value
      is then inserted into the output text</p>.

    <p>Restart the server and visit the same URL again. This time, you should see the current date and time. That's
      because the expression between ${ and } was evaluated as Gosu code, converted to a String, and inserted into the
      template.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="parameters">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Controller And View Parameters</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Our application is still rather uninteresting in that it doesn't really accept any input from the user. Let's
      address that by parameterizing our controller and view.</p>

    <p>Modify the viewPost method in PostCx.gs as follows:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function viewPost(post : String) {
    view.ViewPost.render(Writer, post)
  }</pre>
    
    <p>and ViewPost.gst as follows:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;%@ prams (post : String)  %>
&lt;html>
  &lt;body>
    ${post}
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

    <p>We've added a parameter to the viewPost method; its name is post, and its type is String. (Note that unlike in
      Java, the name comes first and the type second.) We've also added a similar parameter to the ViewPost template,
      using the params directive. When Gosu sees this, it modifies the template type's render method to take an
      additional parameter - if we had added the directive but not modified viewPost() to pass in an additional
      argument, that method call would not have compiled.</p>

    <p>When Ronin handles a URL which calls a method with one or more parameters, the values given to those parameters
      are derived from the arguments in the URL. For instance:</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/PostCx/viewPost?post=Hello+world">http://localhost:8080/PostCx/viewPost?post=Hello+world</a></a></p>

    <p>will assign the string "Hello world" to the post parameter of viewPost(). If you access the URL without a post
      parameter, as we did before, the value of the post parameter will be null.</p>

    <p>In a web application, it's important to ensure that you never render user input directly to your HTML (as we have
      done above), since a user could insert malicious code into your page. The RoninTemplate class provides a method
      called h() to help with this. Change the line that says ${post} to ${h(post)}, and the user's input will be
      properly escaped for inclusion in an HTML page.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="layouts">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Layout and Blocks</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Before we go crazy adding controllers and views to our application, here's an observation: the
      &lt;html> and &tl;body> tags aren't likely to change too much between views. It would be nice if there was an easy
      way to
      extract the content that's common to all views to a single place, so that it's easier to change and maintain.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fortunately, there is. Create a file in your view directory called <code>Layout.gst</code> with the following contents:
    </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;%@ params(content()) %>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
   &lt;title>Blog&lt;/title>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
   &lt;div id="content">&lt;% content() %>&lt;/div>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

    <p>The parameter we've defined in this template looks a bit different from our previous template. That's because
      it's a block (also known as a "closure", "first-class function", or "lambda"). The content parameter is itself a
      function, taking no parameters and returning nothing. As you can see in the body of the template, a block can be
      invoked like any other function. Here, we're invoking it in order to render the content of the page within the
      structure we've defined. We can now remove the &lt;html> and &lt;body> tags from ViewPost.gst.</p>

    <p>If you're a Java programmer, it may help to think of a block as being like an instance of Runnable, and invoking
      the block being like calling the run() method. Unlike a Runnable, however, a block can take parameters and return
      a value, and it can access variables from the scope where it's declared.</p>

    <p>Let's modify the viewPost() function to make use of our layout template. Change the contents of the function
      to:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  Layout.render(Writer, \ -> {
    ViewPost.render(Writer, post)
  })</pre>

    <p>and add the following uses statement:</p>
    
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">uses view.Layout</pre>

    <p>The second argument to Layout.render() is a block, which is initiated with the backslash character. As the block
      takes no arguments, it's followed immediately by an arrow (->), then the contents of the block surrounded by curly
      brackets. When this block is invoked, the ViewPost template will be rendered.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Database Interaction</h1>
    </div>

    <p>A blogging application needs a way to store and retrieve data - specifically, posts and comments. Ronin allows
      you to use any mechanism you like for this purpose, but it is particularly well-suited for use with Tosa, a data
      persistence layer that takes advantage of some powerful features of Gosu to make simple database operations very
      convenient.</p>

    <p>Tosa plugs in to Gosu's type system to generate types based on a pre- defined database schema; unlike with many
      other similar frameworks, you don't explicitly define classes for the entities stored in your database. Before you
      can start using Tosa in your Gosu code, then, you need to define your database schema.</p>

    <p>Roninit created a file called <code>model.ddl</code> in my_app/src/db, which is meant to contain the data definition for your
      database. Paste the following SQL in to that file, replacing the sample schema that's currently there, to create
      the database schema:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  CREATE TABLE "Post"(
      "id" BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      "Title" TEXT,
      "Body" TEXT,
      "Posted" TIMESTAMP
  );
  CREATE TABLE "Comment"(
      "id" BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      "Post_id" BIGINT,
      "Name" VARCHAR(255),
      "Text" TEXT,
      "Posted" TIMESTAMP
  );</pre>

    <p>then, from my_app, run:</p>

    <code> $ vark reset-db </code>

    <p>Each entity (Post and Comment) is represented by a table in the database. Each table has one primary key column
      named "id", and some number of other columns containing information about the entity. A Comment has a foreign key
      to the Post on which it was made, as denoted by the column named "Post_id".</p>

    <p>The connection string for your database is managed in the <code>RoninConfig</code> class.  Here is the default
    configuration code:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  if(m == DEVELOPMENT) {
    db.model.Database.JdbcUrl = "jdbc:h2:file:runtime/h2/devdb"
  } else if(m == TESTING) {
    db.model.Database.JdbcUrl = "jdbc:h2:file:runtime/h2/testdb"
  } else if(m == STAGING) {
    db.model.Database.JdbcUrl = "jdbc:h2:file:runtime/h2/stagingdb"
  } else if(m == PRODUCTION) {
    db.model.Database.JdbcUrl = "jdbc:h2:file:runtime/h2/proddb"
  }</pre>

    <p>As you can see, depending on the mode that Ronin is in, it will use various different database connection
      strings. You can always
      tell which database you are connecting to because, like all Gosu code, this is debuggable.</p>
    
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="create_entity">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Creating Entities</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Our database isn't very interesting without any data in it, so let's create a page where the user can enter a new
      post. Add this uses statement to PostCx:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">uses db.model.Post</pre>
  
  <p>and these methods:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function create() {
    Layout.render(Writer, \ -> {
      EditPost.render(Writer, new Post())
    })
  }

  function save(post : Post) {
    // we will fill this in later.
  }</pre>

    <p>The create() method will render a template named EditPost (as we will be using the same template for creating a
      new post and editing an existing post), passing in a new instance of Post. Note that we never defined a Gosu class
      called db.model.Post; that type is generated for us by Tosa because it is a table in the database. When we create
      a new instance here, we are not yet performing any database operations - we're simply creating an object in memory
      which can be read from or persisted to the Post table.</p>

    <p>(If the Gosu editor shows an error on db.model.Post, you may have to restart it in order for it to find the database types.)</p>

    </p>Create the EditPost.gst template in the view directory with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;%@ params(aPost : db.model.Post) %>
&lt;% uses controller.PostCx %>
&lt;% uses db.model.Post %>

&lt;% using(target(PostCx#save(Post))) { %>
&lt;form method="post" action="${TargetURL}">
  &lt;% if(not aPost._New) { %>
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="${n(Post)}" value="${aPost.id}">
  &lt;% } %>
  &lt;input type="text" name="${n(Post#Title}" value="${h(aPost.Title)}">&lt;br>
  &lt;textarea name="${n(Post#Body)}" rows=20 columns=80>${h(aPost.Body)}&lt;/textarea>&lt;br>
  &lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>
&lt;% } %></pre>

    <p>Let's walk through this template. The first two lines should appear familiar to you. Note that the type of the
      parameter is our entity type, since that's what we're passing in from the controller.</p>

    <p>The first code snippet after the uses statements opens a using statement. This is a Gosu construct which allows
      you to safely initialize and dispose of resources used within the contained code. Here, we are calling a method on
      RoninTempate called target(), and using the context object that it returns.</p>

    <p>The parameter we're passing in to target() is a method literal, indicated by the use of the # operator (instead
      of a dot operator). Whereas a dot operator would cause the method to be called, the # operator simply represents a
      theoretical future call to the method, and it returns a MethodReference object. target() takes the method literal
      to mean that you are defining some part of your template in the context of a call to the save() method.</p>

    <p>(Method literals come in two flavors - those with bound arguments and those with unbound arguments. If specific
      values are provided for the method's arguments, they are said to be bound; if only the types of the arguments are
      specified, as is the case here, they are unbound. target() does not require bound arguments.)</p>

    <p>The action attribute of the form tag is being set to the string returned by the TargetURL property. Since we're
      inside the using statement defined on the previous line, the TargetURL will be the URL to which our form should be
      posted in order to invoke the save() method: http://localhost:8080/PostCx/save.</p>

    <p>So why not just put that URL in the action attribute by hand? Say you change the name of the save method for some
      reason. If the URL were hard-coded in your HTML, you wouldn't know anything was wrong until you ran your
      application, tried to submit the form, and got an error. Using the target() method, on the other hand, means that
      PostCx#save(Post) will not compile if the method has been renamed (or its signature has been changed, etc.), so
      you'll see instantly in the editor that something is wrong.</p>

    <p>After the form tag, we have an if statement. If the post passed in to this template is not a new post, we want to
      store its ID in a hidden input, so that we know which post to edit when the form is posted to the server. We
      determine whether the post is new by accessing the _New property, which is created automatically on all Tosa
      entity types, and returns true as long as the entity has not yet been saved to the database.</p>

    <p>Since we know our post will be a new post for now, let's skip ahead. After we've closed the if statement, we have
      a text field for the post's title. The value of the text field is set to the title of the existing post object,
      aPost.Title (after being escaped by the h() function). The name of the field is set by a call to a helper method
      named n() (for "name"). The argument to n() is a property literal, which is like a method literal, but for a
      property instead of a method - here, for the Title property on Post. n() finds the parameter to save() which takes
      a Post, and generates the appropriate input name to set the Title property (here, post.Title). The text area on
      the next line performs the same task for the Body of the post.</p>

    <p>Let's go over what will happen when we submit this form, say with the title "Hi" and the body text "Hello world".
      The browser will access the URL http://localhost:8080/PostCx/save, with the form data
      post.Title=Hi&post.Body=Hello+world. Ronin will find the save function and see that it requires a db.model.Post
      parameter; since we haven't told it a specific one to use, it will create a new one. It will then examine the form
      data, and set the Title property of the post to "Hi" and the Body property to "Hello world". This will all happen
      automatically, so most of the time you won't have to worry about it.</p>

    <p>Now we'll go back and implement the save() method on PostCx:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function save(post : Post) {
    if(post._New) {
      post.Posted = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis())
    }
    post.update()
    redirect(#viewPost(post))
  }</pre>

    <p>If the post is a new post (as it is in our case), we will set its Posted property to the current time. (Note that
      the type of the Posted property is java.sql.Timestamp, since the Posted column in the database is a TIMESTAMP
      column.) After we've done this, we save the post to the database by calling its update() method (which is created
      for us by Tosa). Finally, we redirect the user to a page where they can view the newly saved post.</p>

    <p>This redirection bears further examination.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">redirect(#viewPost(post))</pre>

    <p>redirect() is a method we've inherited from RoninController. It takes a single argument, which is a method
      literal with bound arguments. Note that since the method in question is on the same class, we don't need anything
      before the # operator. redirect() examines the method reference and determines what URL would invoke it, then
      sends the browser a response telling it to redirect to that URL.</p>

    <p>(By sending a redirect to the browser, we're ensuring that if the user hits the back button, they are returned to
      the edit screen, instead of to the URL which saved the post - that would result in a duplicate post being saved to
      the database. It's generally a good idea to redirect after any action that changes data or is otherwise not
      idempotent.)</p>

    <p>Let's quickly modify viewPost() to actually view a post:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function viewPost(post : Post) {
    view.Layout.render(Writer,
      \ -> view.ViewPost.render(Writer, post))
  }</pre>
    
<p>And the ViewPost.gst template:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  &lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
  &lt;%@ params(post : db.model.Post) %>

  &lt;div class="header">${h(post.Title)}&lt;/div>
  &lt;div class="body">${h(post.Body)}&lt;/div>
  &lt;div class="posted">Posted on ${post.Posted}&lt;/div></pre>
  
  <p>All the pieces are in place. Restart the server, go to http://localhost:8080/PostCx/create, and create a new post.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="edit_entity">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Editing Entities</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Now let's say we want to edit the post we've created. As we noted above, we can reuse the same template. Let's go
      back to the if block that we skipped before:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <% if(not post._New) { %>
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="${n(Post)}" value="${post.id}">
    <% } %> </pre>

    <p>If the template receives an existing post, it will create a hidden input on the form whose value is the post's
      unique ID (primary key). The name of the input is generated by calling n() with the Post type, which finds the
      parameter of that type expected by save(), so when Ronin calls save(), it will use the ID to look up the existing
      post in the database. The Title and Body properties of that post will then be set using the values of those
      inputs, just as they were before, and the save() method will update the entity in the database.</p>

    <p>So how do we get an existing post into the EditPost template? Create the following function in PostCx:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function edit(post : Post) {
    Layout.render(Writer, \-> 
      EditPost.render(Writer, post))
  }</pre>

    <p>That's all there is to it. When http://localhost:8080/PostCx/edit is accessed, Ronin will use the URL parameters
      to look up the post and pass it in to the edit() method, which passes it in to the template.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="links">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Links</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Let's put it all together by creating a link on the "view post" page to edit the post you're viewing. Add this
      snippet to the <code>ViewPost.gst</code> template, wherever you'd like:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;a href="${urlFor(PostCx#edit(post))}">Edit post&lt;/a></pre>
    
    <p>and this uses statement at the top:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
  <% uses controller.PostCx %></pre>

    <p>The target of the link is generated by the urlFor method, which (like redirect()) takes a bound method literal
      for the controller method you want the link to call. Let's see how this works. Make a note of the URL you arrived
      at after creating your new post earlier (or just keep that browser tab open). Restart the server, then go back to
      that URL (or reload the page). You should see the new link appear. If you look at where the link goes, it should
      be something like:</p>

    <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/PostCx/edit?post=1">http://localhost:8080/PostCx/edit?post=1</a></p>

    <p><code>urlFor()</code> generated a URL which, when requested, will invoke the
      <code>controller.PostCx.edit()</code> function, passing in the Post with the primary key 1.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="relationships">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Relationships Between Entities</h1>
    </div>


    <p>Now let's take a look at the other table in our database - comments. Ideally we want to show all of the comments
      for a post on the page where we view the post. Add the following code to the bottom of <code>ViewPost.gst</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">
  <% for (comment in post.Comments) { %>
    &lt;div class="comment">
      &lt;div class="commentAuthor">${comment.Name} - ${comment.Posted}&lt;/div>
      &lt;div class="commentBody">${comment.Text}&lt;/div>
    &lt;/div>
  <% } %></pre>

    <p>This is a Gosu for loop, which is similar to a Java for loop, but with the in keyword in place of the :
      character. The collection we're looping over - <code>post.Comments</code> - is of particular interest here. You'll notice that
      it doesn't correspond to a column on the Post table in our schema above. Instead, it represents the Post_id
      foreign key on the Comment table. <code>post.Comments</code> will return all of the Comments whose Post_id matches the id of
      the post.</p>

    <p>Also note that, unlike in Java, we haven't explicitly stated the type of the comment variable. Gosu infers the
      correct type for this variable because it knows that post.Comments
      contains objects of that type.</p>

  </section>
  
  <section id="querying">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Querying The Database</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Let's add one final piece to our application - a page which lists all of the posts we've created, in reverse chronological order.</p>

    <p>Add the following function to <code>PostRx</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function all() {
    var posts = Post.selectAll().orderBy(Post#Posted, DESC).toList()
    Layout.render(Writer, \ -> AllPosts.render(Writer, posts))
  }
  
</pre>
    <p>The first line of the function declares a local variable. As in our for loop, it is not necessary to specify the type of the variable - Gosu will infer the correct type from the value you assign to it. Instead, you use the var keyword to declare the variable.</p>

    <p>The selectAll() method is one of several static methods present on all types generated by Tosa.
       It returns a QueryResult object that will return all Posts in the database (we could have used select(), selectWhere(),
       or selectLike() if we wanted to add a WHERE clause to the query).  We then applying an ordering to the query before
       it's issued, using the orderBy() method, which takes two parameters:  the first is the property we want to sort on,
       while the second parameter is the sort direction.  We specify the Post#Posted property, so the posts will be sorted chronologically,
       and DESC as the sort direction so that more recent posts will appear first.  The second parameter is optional and defaults to ASC.  If we needed
       a more complicated sort, we could have used orderBySql() instead, which takes a direct Sql statement to use as the
       order by clause.  Lastly, we materialize the results as a List to pass off to our template by using toList().  (We could
       have also simply passed the QueryResult itself off to a template that was expecting to get an Iterable instead of a List.)</p>

    <p>We then pass the list of posts to a new template, <code>AllPosts.gst.</code> Create this file and give it the following contents:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
&lt;%@ params(posts : List&lt;db.model.Post>) %>
  &lt;% uses controller.PostCx %>¡

  &lt;div class="header">All Posts&lt;/div>

  &lt;% for(post in posts) { %>
  &lt;div class="postListEntry">
    &lt;a href="${urlFor(PostCx#viewPost(post))}">${post.Title}&lt;/a>
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;% } %></pre>
    <p>By this point, everything here should be familiar.</p>

      <li>Implement the ability to add comments to a post.</li>
      <li>Using the delete() method on Tosa entities, implement the ability to delete a post or comment.</li>
      <li>Implement a page which displays a snippet of each post, with a link to the full post and some text indicating
        how many comments have been left on the post.
      </li>
      <li>Using the page() and loadPage() methods on the QueryResult, display posts 20 at a time on the AllPosts page.</li>
      <li>Using the selectWhere() method, show "previous" and "next" links on the ViewPost page.</li>
      <li>Refactor the comments display to a separate controller method and view, and use blocks to include it in the
        ViewPost page. Use AJAX to refresh just the comments display when the user leaves a comment.
      </li>
      <li>Implement user authentication by using the built-in support described here.</li>
