    <p>Here's what you need to get started with Ronin:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Java 6 or later.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vark/Aardvark/downloads">Aardvark</a>, a build system for Gosu. Version 0.4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With the aardvark binary <code>vark</code> on your path, you can run the remote Ronin installation script:</p>

        <pre>
  $ vark -f http://ronin-web.org/init.vark init -name <em>my_app</em></pre>

    <p>Where <em>my_app</em> is whatever name you would like for your Ronin application. You will see output like this:

    <p>Ronin applications are very self contained.  All dependencies are managed via the Maven POM dependency model and
    so there are no global libraries to worry about, nor is it typically necessary to check in jars.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="server_config">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Server Configuration</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Configuration of a Ronin server is done by creating a class in the <code>config.RoninConfig</code> class. Ronin
      finds
      this class reflectively at startup if it exists. This class must implement <code>IRoninConfig</code>; more
      commonly, you will
      want to subclass <code>DefaultRoninConfig</code>, which provides standard implementations of the methods on
      IRoninConfig.</p>

    <p>Most common configuration should be performed by overriding DefaultRoninConfig's constructor, calling super(),
      and then setting the following properties:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The default action is set via the <code>DefaultAction</code> property, and defaults to "index". This is the
        name of the
        controller method that Ronin attempts to call if no method is specified in a URL - for instance,
        "http://localhost:8080/Main" will attempt to call <code>controller.Main.index()</code>. The default action can
        not take any
        parameters. If no such method exists on a controller, an error will be thrown as with any other malformed URL.
        Note that this property is a String, since it likely refers to multiple methods across controller classes, and
        therefore is not type-safe.
      </li>
      <li>The default controller is set via the <code>DefaultController</code> property, and defaults to <code>controller.Main</code>
        if such a
        class exists. The default controller is a controller class to which URLs which do not specify a controller -
        i.e. the URL of the application's root - are directed. For instance, if <code>DefaultController</code> is <code>controller.Main,</code>
        and assuming <code>DefaultAction</code> has the default value of "index", then "http://localhost:8080" will
        attempt to call
        <code>controller.Main.index()</code>. Unlike <code>DefaultAction</code>, this property is a type literal, so
        specifying an invalid
        controller class will cause a compile error.
      </li>
      <li>Error handling is performed by setting the <code>ErrorHandler</code> property. The type of
        <code>ErrorHandler</code> is <code>IErrorHandler</code>,
        an interface with two methods: <code>on404()</code> and <code>on500()</code>. <code>on404()</code> is called
        when a URL attempts to access a controller
        or action which does not exist; <code>on500()</code> is called when the parameters in the URL are malformed or
        do not match
        the action method's signature. (It's also called if your controller is somehow incorrectly configured, e.g. it
        does not extend <code>RoninController</code>.) The default implementation of each method simply logs the error
        and sets the
        response code to 404 or 500, respectively. You are encouraged to override these methods to provide more graceful
        error handling, either by rendering a friendly error message to the user or by redirecting the request
        appropriately.
      </li>
      <li>Several other advanced configuration properties are available to customize caching behavior, log/trace levels,
        etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="controllers">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Controllers</h1>
    </div>

    <p>A controller in Ronin is simply a class in the "controller" package containing one or more methods. There's
      nothing magic about these methods; they can do anything a normal method would do. They can even call each other,
      for example, to render subcomponents of a page.</p>

    <p>Each controller class should correspond loosely to a broad division of your application, whether it be controller
      methods operating on a particular object in your data model, rendering the pages of a particular subsection of
      your site, etc. The name of the controller class will be the first part of the URL used to call a controller
      method in the class. For instance, the URL "http://localhost:8080/Main/view" will call the <code>view()</code> method on
      <code>controller.Main.</code></p>

    <p>Controller methods must be public in order to be called by Ronin in response to a user request. Gosu methods are
      public by default, so you don't need to add any modifiers to them. Any helper functions or functions containing
      common code called from multiple controller methods should be declared "private", "protected", or "internal", to
      avoid being accessible by a curious or malicious end user via a URL.</p>

    <p>While a controller method can contain any arbitrary code, in a typical web application they will tend to follow
      one of two patterns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code that retrieves data, potentially based on user input, and then calls a view template's render() method.
      </li>
      <li>Code that manipulates data in response to an HTTP POST request, and then calls redirect(). Redirecting the
        user to a controller method of the first type will prevent the POST from happening a second time if the user
        hits the browser's back button.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This interaction model is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get">Post/Redirect/Get
      model</a>. That being said, again, Ronin does not prescribe any particular model - you are free to structure your
      controller methods in any way you see fit.</p>
    
    <p>If you would like to restrict a particular controller method to certain HTTP methods - for instance, only allow POST requests to the method - use the <code>@Methods</code> annotation:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  @Methods({POST})
  function myControllerMethod() {
    ...
  }</pre>
    
    <p>Likewise, if you would like to restrict a controller method to accepting HTTPS requests only, use the <code>@HttpsOnly</code> annotation:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  @HttsOnly
  function myControllerMethod() {
    ...
  }</pre>

    <p>If <code>@HttpsOnly</code> is applied to a controller <b>class</b>, then all methods in that class will require HTTPS.</p>

    <p>A controller class must extend the RoninController base class. Doing so provides your controller class with
      access to the following properties and methods:</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Method/Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Writer</code></td>
        <td>The output writer for the HTTP response. For a normal web request, this will be what is
          rendered to the user's browser. <code>Writer</code> should be passed to any templates rendered by the
          controller.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Method</code></td>
        <td>The HTTP method specified by the user's request. It is an instance of the <code>HttpMethod</code>
          enum, which contains the values GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Session</code></td>
        <td>A map containing data pertinent to the current user's session. The map's keys are
          Strings, and its values are untyped Objects, so you can put data in the session by saying e.g. <code>Session["userName"]
            = "admin"</code> and retrieve session data by saying e.g. <code>print(Session["userName"])</code>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Referrer</code></td>
        <td>The referring URL of the current request (i.e., the page from which the user clicked
          a link to generate the request) as a String.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Request</code></td>
        <td>An object representing the user's HTTP request. This is an

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>redirect()</code></td>
        <td>Sends a redirect response to the user's browser; this is typically done after a POST action from an
          HTML form. The argument to <code>redirect()</code> is a feature literal of the desired controller method for the target of
          the redirect; see Link Targets for more information. Generally, you do not want to do anything further after a
          call to <code>redirect()</code>.

      <tr>
        <td><code>bounce()</code></td>

          always reliable, as the user may have navigated to the URL directly, in which case there is no referring URL to
          bounce them to, or they may have configured their browser not to send referrer information.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

    </table>

    <p>
      If there is functionality that's common to all methods on a controller, you can override the <code>beforeRequest()</code> and
      <code>afterRequest()</code> methods. <code>beforeRequest()</code> is called before each request to the controller, and returns a boolean
      value which allows it (if false) to prevent the request from being processed further. Code to ensure that the user
      is logged in and has permission to perform a given action can go here. <code>afterRequest()</code> is called after the
      controller method returns, and can perform cleanup on anything done in <code>beforeRequest()</code>.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="controller_args">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Controller Arguments</h1>
    </div>

    <p>A controller method which takes no arguments, for instance <code>controller.Main#index()</code>, is accessed via a simple URL
      - in this case, "http://localhost:8080/Main/index". If a controller method takes one or more arguments, however,
      it will accept URL parameters corresponding to those arguments, either as part of the URL itself (e.g.
      "http://localhost:8080/Post/view?id=5") or in the body of the request (as with a request generated by submitting
      an HTML form). The method will be called with the values provided by the request. If a parameter is not included
      in the request, null will be passed in (or false for boolean parameters).</p>

    <h2>Simple Parameters</h2>

    <p>If the method parameter's type is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>boolean</li>
      <li>int/long/float/double</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Date</li>
    </ul>

    <p>or any other type to which Gosu can coerce a String, it will be set directly using the value in the request. So
      given the following controller method signature:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">  controller.Main.index(b : boolean, i : int, s : String, d : Date) </pre>

    <p>the following URL:</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/Main/index?b=true&i=5&s=Hello&d=07-11-1980">http://localhost:8080/Main/index?b=true&i=5&s=Hello&d=07-11-1980</a></p>

    <p>will construct a controller object and call this method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">(new controller.Main()).index(true, 5, "Hello", new java.util.Date("07-11-1980"))</pre>

    <h2>Entity Parameters</h2>

    <p>If a parameter is of some other type, Ronin will attempt to find a static method on that type called <code>fromId()</code> which
      takes a single parameter and returns an instance of the desired type. (In this documentation we will refer to such
      types as entity types, though they can be any Gosu type.) If it finds such a method, it will call it, passing in
      the value from the request, and assign the result to the controller method's parameter.</p>

    <p>For instance, given the following class:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
class Person {
  static function fromId(id : long) : Person {
    return fetchPersonFromDb(id)
  }
  ...
}</pre>
      <p>and the following controller method on <code>controller.Main</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function viewPerson(p : Person) {
    ...
  }
    </pre>

    <p>the URL</p>

    <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/Main/viewPerson?id=5">http://localhost:8080/Main/viewPerson?id=5</a></p>

    <p>will call</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">(new controller.Main()).viewPerson(Person.fromId(5))</pre>

    <p>Note that you can use a Gosu enhancement to add <code>fromId()</code> to an existing type, such as a Hibernate class, thus
      turning it into a valid Ronin entity type. You could even enhance a single interface implemented by all of your
      entity types, though be careful to ensure that <code>fromID()</code> always returns the concrete type, not the interface type
      (most likely through the use of a type parameter on the enhancement). Consult the Gosu documentation for further
      details on enhancements.</p>

    <h2>Complex Parameters</h2>
    
    <p>Parameters of a non-primitive type and array parameters support a more advanced syntax. Individual properties of a non-primitive parameter can be set from URL parameters using a dot-path syntax. For instance, given the following method signature:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">function updatePerson(p : Person)</pre>
    
    <p>where Person is a Gosu class defining the following property:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">var _name : String as Name</pre>

    <p>the URL "http://localhost:8080/Main/updatePerson?p=0&p.Name=Bob" will call <code>Person.fromId(0)</code>, then
      set the <code>Name</code> property on that instance of Person to "Bob".</p>

    <p>If a property is specified in the URL, but no ID is given for the instance - e.g.
      "http://localhost:8080/Main/updatePerson?p.Name=Bob" - a new <code>Person</code> will be instantiated, and its Name set to
      "Bob". (This assumes that Person defines a constructor with no arguments.)</p>

    <p>For array parameters, an array is created automatically. Elements in the array are specified in the URL using
      standard array notation, e.g. "names[0]=Bob&names[1]=Fred". If the parameter is an array of entity types, each
      value specified in this way is passed to fromID() to retrieve the appropriate element.</p>

    <p>Complex parameters make it very easy to create an HTML form for creating or updating an entity. The controller
      method to which the form points need only take a single parameter, the entity, and the name of each input in the
      form is a dot path for the property it edits (e.g. "p.Name", or "p.PhoneNumber").</p>

    <h2>Restricting properties</h2>


    <p>Setting properties on a parameter via request parameters could conceivably pose a security risk. For instance,
      say you have a page where a user can edit their profile. This page posts to the following controller method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function saveUser(u : User) {
    [code to save User object to database]
  }</pre>

    <p>An attacker could trick a user into posting to this method with the parameter u.Password set to some value known
      to the attacker.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Ronin allows you to specify that certain properties should never be set automatically from
      request parameters. There are two ways to do this. If the property in question is on a Gosu class, you can use the
      <code>@Restricted</code> annotation:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  @Restricted
  var _password : String as Password</pre>

    <p>On the other hand, if the property is on another kind of type, or if you don't have control over the class where
      it's defined (e.g. it's part of a third-party library), you can set the <code>RestrictedProperties</code> from the
      constructor of your <code>RoninConfig</code> class:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  RestrictedProperties = { User#Password, User#Salt, ... }</pre>

    <h2>Alternative Argument Passing</h2>

    <p>In addition to passing parameters to a method as part of the URL, you can also pass them as form-encoded data in
      the body of the HTTP request. This is what will happen when you submit an HTML form, for example.</p>

    <p>You can also pass in parameters via JSON in the body of the request. This could be useful if, for instance, your
      application supports clients other than a web browser, or you're using a Javascript UI framework which uses JSON
      for AJAX requests. JSON handling is important enough to warrant its own section:</p>
  </section>

  <section id="json_support">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>JSON Support</h1>
    </div>

    <p>If Ronin receives a request whose Content-Type header is set to "text/json", it will expect the values to pass in
      to the parameters of the target controller method to be encoded as JSON in the request body (instead of
      form-encoded data in the request body or URL).</p>

    <p>This is best shown by example. Say you have the following Gosu class:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  class Person {
    var _name : String as Name
    var _age : int as Age
  }</pre>
    
  <p>and the following controller class:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  class PersonCx extends RoninController {
    function friendsNamed(p : Person, names : String[]) {
      ...
    }
  }</pre>
    
  <p>The body of a JSON-based request to friendsNamed() might look something like this:</p>
  
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  {
    "p" : {
      "Name": "Bob",
      "Age": 25
    },
    "names": [
      "Sue",
      "Frank",
      "Joey"
    ]
  }</pre>

    <p>The body of the request is a single JSON object, with a property defined for each of the method's parameters. The
      first parameter's type is Person, so the value passed in is another JSON object, with properties corresponding to
      each of that object's properties. The second parameter is an array of Strings, so the value passed in is a JSON
      array containing strings.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="views">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Views</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Controller methods which are meant to return output to a response (e.g. those which don't call redirect()) can do
      so in one of two ways: returning a String, or using the Writer property. For simple output (e.g. a simple response
      to an AJAX request), it may be easier to just return the desired output as a String from the controller method.
      For more complex output, including HTML pages, passing the Writer to a view is recommended.</p>

    <p>A view in Ronin is typically just a Gosu template. (See the Gosu documentation for more information on
      templates.) Unlike controller classes, templates can be in any package, but the convention is to place them in the
      <code>view</code> pacakge.</p>

    <p>For views which render HTML, you should not hard-code link URLs and form targets in the HTML. This could lead to
      broken links if you remove or rename a controller class or method, or change its parameters. Instead, use the
      urlFor(), postUrlFor(), and target() methods (see below).</p>

    <p>It is recommended that the following directive be inserted at the top of each Ronin template:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint"><%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %></pre>

    <p>This allows Gosu code in the template unqualified access to the following convenience methods:</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

      <tr>
        <th>Method/Property</th>

      <tr>
        <td><code>postUrlFor()</code></td>

    </section>

  <section id="link_targets">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Link Targets</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The <code>redirect()</code> method on a controller class and the <code>urlFor()</code> method on a view template
      both take a single argument, which is a feature literal representing the target of the redirect or the URL.<p>

    <p>Feature literals are a feature of Gosu that allow you to reference a method or property without invoking it.
      They are used extensively in Ronin.  Let's look at an example:</p>

    <p>Say you have the following method on <code>controller.Main</code>:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function addComment(p : Post, text : String) {
   ...
  }</pre>
    
    <p>and you want to create a link which will add a comment with the text "Hello" to a particular post. The following
      code will give you the URL for that link:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  var post = [code to retrieve the post goes here]
  var url = urlFor(controller.Main#addComment(post, "Hello"))</pre>

    <p>The # operator is what makes this a feature literal, rather than a method invocation, and addComment() will not
      be called by this code. Instead, urlFor() returns "http://localhost:8080/Main/addComment?p=5&text=Hello" (assuming
      the post's ID is 5).</p>

    <p>As a side note, the syntax for feature literals in Gosu was taken from JavaDoc.</p>

    <p>In order for entity types to work with these methods, they must define a method called toId() which takes no
      arguments and returns a unique identifier for the object on which it is called. (This identifier, when passed to
      the type's fromId() method, should return the original object.)</p>

    </section>
  
  <section id="logging_tracing">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Logging And Tracing</h1>
    </div>

    <p>You can log in Controllers and Views by using the log() method:</p>

    
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  package controller

  class MyController {
    function index() {
      log( "Rendering index...")
      Main.render(Writer)
    }
  }</pre>

    <p>The <code>log()</code> method takes advantage of Gosu's named arguments and default parameters, allowing you to
      better target your log message:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    log( "A debug message", :level = DEBUG ) // only logs if debug logging is enabled via RoninServlet#LogLevel
    log( "A message in the model", :component = "Model" ) // a log message associated w/ the "Model" component
    try {
      something()
    } catch( e ) {
      log( "An exception occurred!", :exception = e ) // logs the exception
    }</pre>
    
    <p>You can combine named parameters for more elaborate logging messages.</p>

    <p>The default logging level is INFO.</p>

    <h2>Lazy Logging</h2>

    <p>Sometimes your logging message might be expensive to compute, and you only want to perform the computation if the
      log message is actually going to be written. You can achieve this by using a no-argument block to the log
      method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">log( \-> aVeryExpensiveMethod(), :level = DEBUG )</pre>
    
    <p>Unless the Ronin application is configured to log debugging messages, <code>aVeryExpensiveMethod()</code> will never be called.</p>

    <h2>Configuring Logging</h2>

    <p>By default, Ronin uses the SLF4J API for logging. It includes an SLF4J implementation that outputs log messages
      to the console based on the LogLevel property on RoninConfig. If you'd like to use a different SLF4J
      implementation (e.g. log4j), remove the roninlog dependency in your pom and implement a SLF4J initializer</p>

    <p>If you don't want to use SLF4J at all, you can replace the logging implementation wholesale. In your
      <code>config.RoninConfig</code> class you can set up a new logging adapter like so:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  package config

  uses ronin.*
  uses ronin.config.*

  /**
  * This class gives you a way to programatically configure the ronin servlet
  */
  class RoninConfig implements IRoninConfig {
    construct(m : ApplicationMode, an : RoninServlet) {
      super(m, an)
      DefaultController = controller.Main
      DefaultAction = "index"
      LogHandler = new MyCustomLogHandler() // <-- set up a custom log handler
    }
  }</pre>
          
    <p>Where <code>MyCustomLogHandler</code> is a Gosu class that implements the <code>ronin.config.ILogHandler</code> interface.</p>

    <p>This class can wire through to whatever you like: StdOut, Log4j, whatever.</p>

    <h2>Tracing</h2>

    <p>Ronin provides basic tracing support to help you understand where time is going in requests. While this is not a
      complete substitute for serious profiling tools like JProfiler, it can give you a good idea of why your
      application is so slow.</p>

    <p>By default, Ronin (and Tosa) log controller calls, template rendering and SQL statements. Here is an example trace from RoBlog:</p>

    <pre>
    [java] INFO Ronin - request for /PostCx/index - 1104.521 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -   controller.PostCx.beforeRequest() - 0.214 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -   controller.PostCx.index - 555.263 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -   db.roblog.BlogInfo.selectAll() - 1.005 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -     SELECT * FROM BlogInfo ([]) - 0.124 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -   view.Layout.render() - 239.046 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -     db.roblog.BlogInfo.selectAll() - 0.519 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -       SELECT * FROM BlogInfo ([]) - 0.124 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -     view.All.render() - 135.492 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -       db.roblog.Post.selectAll() - 0.884 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -         SELECT * FROM Post ORDER BY Posted DESC LIMIT ? OFFSET ? ([20, 0]) - 0.562 ms
    [java] INFO Ronin -   controller.PostCx.afterRequest() - 0.103 ms 
    </pre>
    
    <p>This gives you a good idea of the perf "shape" of your requests, and where optimizations might be necessary.</p>

    <p>If you wish to add a custom trace component in a Controller or Template, you can use the <code>trace()</code> method like so:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    function myExpensiveFunction() {
      using( trace("myExpensiveMethod") ) {
        // some expensive logic
      }
    }</pre>

    <p>The "myExpensiveMethod" string will now appear in your trace with a timing and with all elements that occur
      within the using statement nested below it. This can help you narrow down what, exactly is causing slowness in
      your app.</p>

    <p>Note that trace(), like log(), can take a no-argument block that returns a String, so that expensive trace
      messages can be constructed only if necessary.</p>

    </section>

  <section id="caching">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Caching</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Ronin provides a simple way to cache values in various stores, the <code>cache()</code> method:</p>

     <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function myExpensiveFunction() : String {
    return cache( \-> computeTheExpensiveString() )
  }</pre>

    <p>The <code>cache()</code> method takes a block and returns the value of the block or, if it has already been
      computed, returns the cached value.</p>

    <p>By default, the cached value will last for the duration of a single request.</p>

    <h2>Stores</h2>

    <p>Sometimes caching for a single request isn't good enough. Ronin provides three different stores: REQUEST (the
      default), SESSION (associated with the users session) and APPLICATION (global). Let's change the code above to
      store the value in the session, for additional perf win:</p>

     <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function myExpensiveFunction() : String {
    return cache( \-> computeTheExpensiveString(), :store = SESSION )
  }</pre>

    <p>Now the value produced by <code>computeTheExpensiveString()</code> will be only computed once per user session,
      rather than on every request.</p>

    <p>Once you start storing caches at the session level, you are probably going to have to worry about invalidating
      them as well. This can be done by giving the cache a name:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function myExpensiveFunction() : String {
    return cache( \-> computeTheExpensiveString(), :store = SESSION, :name = "MySweetCache" )
  }</pre>
  
    <p>Allowing you to invalidate the cache with the <code>invalidate()</code> method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function updateExpensiveFunctionsValue()  {
    updateTheDataThatTheExpensiveStringDependsOn()
    invalidate( "MySweetCache" )
  }</pre>
    
    <p>Note that cache names must be unique within their store.</p>

    <h2>Caching Strategery</h2>

    <blockquote>
      "There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton
    </blockquote>

    <p>Well, here you've got both of these problems, so humility is the best policy.</p>

    <p>Caches should be few, minimal and judicious, striking at the optimal place in the call stack to cut off expensive computations. You should always, always, always have empirical evidence that a cache is needed before you introduce this complexity to your app.</p>
    
  </section>

  <section id="file_upload">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>File Upload</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>Ronin provides seamless support for files uploaded via HTTP requests (e.g. via a "file" type input in an HTML
      form).</p>

    <p>Uploaded files are treated just like any other controller arguments. The type of the method parameter can be
      either <code>byte[]</code> or <code>InputStream</code>; in the former case, the entire contents of the file will be read into the array,
      while the latter case provides stream-based access, which may be more appropriate for larger files.</p>

    <p>For example, given the following HTML form:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  &lt;% using(target(FileCx#uploadFile(byte[]))) { %>
  &lt;form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="${TargetURL}" method="POST">
    &lt;input type="file" name="${n(0)}"/>
  &lt;/form>
  &lt;% } %></pre>
    
    <p>and the following controller method:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  function uploadFile(myFile : byte[]) {
    ...
  }</pre>
  
    <p>the myFile parameter will contain the bytes of the uploaded file.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="user_auth">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>User Authentication</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Ronin provides a convenient framework for handling user authentication in your app. It defines an interface,
      IAuthManager, and a default implementation using Apache Shiro. All that you need to provide is a basic user model
      - a way to retrieve a user object by its username, and to determine the appropriate login credentials from that
      object.</p>

    <p>The AuthManager property on IRoninConfig stores the object responsible for handling authentication. To use the
      default authentication manager, insert the following in the constructor of your <code>RoninConfig</code> class (see Server
      Configuration):</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    AuthManager = createDefaultAuthManager( \ username -> User.find(new User(){:Name = username})[0],
      null, User#Name, User#Hash, User#Salt
    )</pre>

    <p>The actual parameters passed to <code>createDefaultAuthManager()</code> will vary for your particular application.
      <code>createDefaultAuthManager</code> is a method on <code>DefaultRoninConfig</code>; if your <code>RoninConfig</code> does not extend
      <code>DefaultRoninConfig</code>, you'll need to write the equivalent method.</p>

    <p>The first parameter to createDefaultAuthManager is a block which takes a username as a String and returns the
      corresponding user. The second parameter is used for OpenID support (see below); you can pass in null if you're
      not planning to support OpenID. The third, fourth, and fifth parameters are references to properties on that
      object which return, respectively, the user's name, a hash of the user's password, and the salt used to construct
      that hash. (More on this later.)</p>

    <p>The optional fifth parameter is a reference to a property on the user object which returns a list of strings
      representing the roles of the user. Typically these are used to restrict access to a particular part of the
      application to a subset of users. There is no need to specify this parameter if you don't plan on using roles.</p>

    <p>The optional sixth and seventh parameters specify the hashing algorithm and the number of hash iterations used
      when computing a password hash. The default values here should be fine; do not pass in values for these parameters
      unless you're sure you know what you're doing.</p>

    <p>Once you've initialized the authentication manager, you can access it in all of your controllers and templates as
      AuthManager. The properties and methods on IAuthManager are:</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Method/Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>login()</code></td>
        <td>Takes a username and password, and attempts to log in the specified user. It returns true if the user was
          successfully logged in, and false otherwise.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>logout()</code></td>
        <td>Logs out the current user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>CurrentUser</code></td>
        <td>Returns the currently logged in user (represented by the object returned by the block you provided above), or null if no user is logged in.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>CurrentUserName</code></td>
        <td>Returns the currently logged in user's username, or null if no user is logged in.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>currentUserHasRole()</code></td>
        <td>Takes a String representing a role, and returns true if the currently logged in user has that role. If no user is logged in, this method always returns false.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>getPasswordHashAndSalt()</code></td>
        <td>Takes a plaintext password and returns a pair of Strings. The first String is a hash of the password, and the second is the salt used to construct that hash. This hash/salt combination is guaranteed to be produced using the same mechanism that login() uses to check passwords, so you should always use this method when creating a new user or changing a user's password.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Requiring a User to be Logged In</h2>

    <p>It is likely that there are many controller methods in your application that shouldn't be accessed by a user who
      isn't logged in. Usually in such a case, you'd like to redirect the user to a login page, and after they
      successfully log in, let them go to where they were originally trying to go. Ronin automates this pattern for you
      if you set the LoginRedirect property of your RoninConfig. This property should be set to the bound method
      reference for your login page; for example:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">LoginRedirect = AdminCx#login()</pre>

    <p>In the controller method that processes the user's login, you can call the postLoginRedirect() method to send the
      user back to where they were trying to get; you must provide a default target in case the user went directly to
      the login page. For example:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  @NoAuth
  function doLogin(username : String, password : String) {
    if(AuthManager.login(name, pass)) {
      postLoginRedirect(MyCx#index())
    } else {
      redirect(#login())
    }
  }</pre>

    <p>Note the @NoAuth annotation; controller methods with this annotation (and those on a controller class with this
      annotation) bypass the login check and can thus be accessed by non-logged-in users. Needless to say, the
      controller method for the login page itself should also be @NoAuth; if it isn't, your application will throw an
      exception on startup.</p>

    <h2>Using LDAP</h2>

    <p>Ronin provides a convenience method for integrating with an LDAP server for user authentication. Assuming your
      RoninConfig class extends DefaultRoninConfig, insert the following in its constructor:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  AuthManager = createLDAPAuthManager( "ldap://myldapserver:389", "uid={0},ou=users,dc=mycompany,dc=com" )</pre>

    <p>where the first argument is the URL to your LDAP server, and the second argument is your LDAP server's User DN
      format. An optional third argument allows you to specify the authentication mechanism to use, with "simple" being
      the default.</p>

    <h2>Using OpenID</h2>

    <p>OpenID is a standard that allows users to identify themselves via a third-party identity provider. Ronin provides
      turn-key OpenID support, so you can allow users to log in to your application with, for example, their Google
      account.</p>

    <p>To support OpenID, you must first tell the authentication manager how to find a user given the credentials given
      by their OpenID provider - specifically their identity string and e-mail address. Not every OpenID provider will
      provide the user's e-mail address, and not every OpenID provider will provide a unique or reliable identity
      string, so you may have to handle some providers on a case-by-case basis. Here's an example that finds a user in
      the database based on the provided e-mail address:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    AuthManager = createDefaultAuthManager( \ username -> User.find(new User(){:Name = username})[0],
      \ identity, email, provider -> User.find(new User(){:Email = email})[0],
      User#Name, User#Hash, User#Salt
    )</pre>

    <p>(This code is not production-ready, as it doesn't correctly handle the case where no user with the given e-mail
      address is found. If this happens, you can either return null to reject the login, or create a new user and return
      it. It also doesn't check to make sure the e-mail address comes from a reliable provider; it's possible for a
      malicious provider to claim an e-mail address that doesn't actually belong to the user.)</p>

    <p>Once you've initialized the authenication manager so that it knows how to handle OpenID logins, all you need to
      do is add a link or form to your application's login screen. For example:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  &lt;% uses controller.OpenID %>
  &lt;div>
    &lt;a href="${urlFor(OpenID#login(OpenID.GOOGLE, urlFor(PostCx#recent(0))))}">
      Log in with your Google account
    &lt;/a>
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;div>
    &lt;% using(target(OpenID#login(String, String, boolean, String))) { %>
    &lt;form method="post" action="${TargetURL}">
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="${n(0)}" value="${OpenID.VERISIGN}"/>
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="${n(1)}" value="${urlFor(PostCx#recent(0))}"/>
      Log in with your Verisign PIP account: &lt;input type="text" name="${n(3)}"/>
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Go"/>
    &lt;/form>
    &lt;% } %>
  &lt;/div></pre>

    <p><code>controller.OpenID</code> is provided by Ronin out of the box. OpenID#login is the target method for all OpenID logins.
      The first parameter is the OpenID provider's XRDS discovery URL; there are constants for several of the most
      popular providers on the OpenID class, of which we use two here. The second parameter is the default target to
      redirect the user to after logging them in, which is analogous to the argument to <code>postLoginRedirect()</code> described
      above.</p>

    <p>Some OpenID providers, such as Verisign, have a different discovery URL per user. In this case, you should prompt
      the user for their username and pass it to login() as the fourth parameter.</p>

  <section id="csrf">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>CSRF Protection</h1>
    </div>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">Cross-site request forgery </a>is a technique
      whereby users can be tricked into submitting a request to your app that
      appears to be authenticated without their knowledge.</p>

    <p>Ronin offers a simple mechanism for protecting against CSRF attacks. The <code>XSRFTokenName</code> and <code>XSRFTokenValue</code>
      properties, available on all controllers and templates, represent a name/value pair which will authenticate any
      user
      request as coming from within your app.</p>

    <p>By default, once the <code>XSRFTokenValue</code> property has been accessed in the context of a user session, all
      future non-GET
      requests will throw an error if a matching name/value pair is not present in the request. To use this facility,
      then, all you have to do is include the following hidden input in all of the forms in your app:</p>

    <pre>&lt;input type="hidden" name="${XSRFTokenName}" value="${XSRFTokenValue}"></pre>

    <p>AJAX POST requests must also include this name/value pair; how you do so will depend on how you're making the
    request.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to change which HTTP methods to apply XSRF protection to, set the XSRFLevel property on your
    <code>RoninConfig</code> object. Note that you'll have to manually add the XSRF token to the URL of any GET requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="jsonp">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>JSONP</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Ronin provides a simple way to respond to JSONP requests. Simply use the @JSONP annotation, and pass it the name
      of the request parameter which will contain the callback method name:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  class MyCx extends RoninController {
    @JSONP("callback")
      function myAction() {
        Writer.write("{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
      }
    }
  }</pre>
  
    <p>Given this controller method, a request to</p>
    
    <p><a>http://[server address]/MyCx/myAction?callback=myCallback</a></p>

    <p>will respond with</p>

    <pre>myCallback({"foo": "bar"})</pre>

  </section>

  <section id="admin_console">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>The Admin Console</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Ronin provides a powerful admin console to help you perform administrative tasks on a server, or just to poke
      around your development instance.</p>

    <p>The admin console is started by calling <code>AdminConsole.start()</code> from your <code>RoninConfig</code>. The
      default <code>RoninConfig</code> that was generated for you will start an admin console in development mode only,
      on port 8022.</p>

    <h2>Configuring the Admin Console</h2>

    <p>Simply calling <code>AdminConsole.start(),</code> as is done by the default <code>RoninConfig</code>, will start
      an admin console on port 8022 which will accept all logins from the local host in development mode, and deny all
      logins in any other mode. start() takes two optional arguments which allow you to further configure the admin
      console:</p>

    <p><code>authorizedUsers</code> is a list of usernames indicating which users are allowed to access the admin console. (See User
      authentication for details on how to set up a user authentication manager.) If this parameter is provided but no
      authentication manager has been set up, all logins will be denied. Users will use their regular password when
      logging in to the console.</p>

    <p><code>port</code> allows you to use a port other than 8022.</p>

    <h2>Using the Admin Console</h2>

    <p>The admin console is set up as an SSH server. You have two options for connecting to it:</p>

    <p>Use an SSH client. On OS X or Linux, you should be able to run ssh -l [user name] -p 8022 localhost.</p>

    <p>Run vark console. See Aardvark in Ronin.</p>

    <p>Once you've logged in, you'll see a prompt. The admin console functions mostly the same as the Gosu interactive
      shell, which means you can enter any Gosu expression or statement, and you can hit TAB for auto-completion of
      method and property names. The Gosu expressions are run in the context of your Ronin app, so if for instance
      you're using Tosa as your model layer, all of the database types exposed by Tosa are available, and any queries
      you run are run on your actual database.</p>

    <h2>A Word of Warning</h2>

    <p>The admin console is very powerful. To see just how powerful, type the following:</p>

    <pre>java.lang.System.exit(0)</pre>

    <p>This will terminate your Ronin app.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, you shouldn't use the admin console in production unless you have a really good reason to, and
      if you do, you should limit access to the absolute minimum number of users. Any user to whom you wouldn't give
      root access on the machine your app is running on probably shouldn't have access to the admin console.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="aardvark">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Aardvark in Ronin</h1>

    <p>Ronin uses Aardvark for its command-line interface. Aardvark is a Gosu-based scripting tool that integrates
      features from Ant, Ivy and Maven, but allows you to write your build scripts in plain Gosu.</p>

    <p>Your application will automatically have an empty <code>build.vark</code> file created in its root. You can add
      any vark targets you like to this file. Consult http://vark.github.com for more information.</p>

    <p>Ronin provides some default targets out of the box:</p>

          also ensure that you haven't written your tests to be order-dependent, and that you haven't somehow introduced
          any concurrency bugs into your application. However, it can be more difficult to write tests that run

  <section id="cron">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Cron Jobs</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>A common need for web applications is to schedule background processes to run at certain
    intervals.  Ronin provides a simple API for this purpose, based on the popular Quartz
    library.</p>

    <p>To schedule a task you can use the <code>schedule()</code> method available in your <code>RoninConfig</code>
    class when setting up your Ronin application.  Here is a simple example:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">schedule( :atHour = 1, :task = \-> scrubTempDirectory() )</pre> 

    <p>This would schedule the <code>scrubTempDirectory()</code> method to be run every day at 1AM.  Of course the
    body of the block can be any arbitrary expression, so a more complicated job might be encapsulated
    in a class and invoked:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">schedule( :atHour = 1, :task = \-> new TempDirScrubber().run() )</pre>

    <p>Or not.</p>

    <p>If you wanted to schedule a job for midnight and 12 pm you could use the `:atHours` argument instead,
    which takes a list of hours to run at:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">schedule( :atHours = {0, 12}, :task = \-> scrubTempDirectory() )</pre>

    <p>Your scheduling can get quite elaborate, if necessary:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">
  schedule( :atSecond = 30, 
            :atMinutes = {15, 45}, :atHours = 1..12, 
            :onDays = {MONDAY, LAST_WEDNESDAY}, :task = \-> doIt() )</pre>

    <p>This example would run at the thirty second mark of the fifteenth and fourty-fifth minute of every hour
    from 1 am to 12 pm, on every Monday and the last Wednesday of the month.  Insane, but that's what
    it would do.</p>

    <p>There are some cron-like options that are not available via the simplified arguments of
    <code>schedule()</code>.  You can pass a <a href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger">raw Quartz cron string</a>
    if you need these more exotic options by using the <code>:cronString</code> parameter:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">schedule( :cronString = "0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005", :task = \-> doIt() )</pre>
    
    <p>According to the Quartz documentation linked to above, this means "Fire at 10:15am on every last
    friday of every month during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005"</p>

    <h2>Why Such An Old Version Of Quartz?</h2>

    <p>We use version 1.5.2 of Quartz because it doesn't have any dependencies, in stark contrast to the
    newer versions, and the functionality provided by the newer versions isn't particularly compelling.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="misc">

    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>Misc</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Headers/Footers</h2>

    <p>A web application will often have a static header and footer surrounding a chunk of generated content. You can
      implement this pattern in Ronin using beforeRequest() and afterRequest() on each controller; however, a more
      flexible implementation is described here which uses blocks, which are Gosu objects that encapsulate some
      functionality (also called "closures" or "lambdas".)</p>

    <p>Define a template for your header/footer - let's call it Layout.gst:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    &lt;%@ extends ronin.RoninTemplate %>
    &lt;%@ params(content()) %>
    &lt;html>
    [header content goes here]
    &lt;% content() %>
    [footer content goes here]
    &lt;/html></pre>

    <p>The parameter specified here, <code>content()</code>, is a block which takes no arguments and has no return
      value.</p>

    <p>Then, in your controller method, render the Layout template, passing in a block which renders your dynamic
      content:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">view.Layout.render(Writer, \ -> view.MyView.render(Writer, args))</pre>

    <p><code>Layout</code> will render the header, then invoke your block, rendering the dynamic content, then render
      the footer.</p>

    <p>Consult the Gosu documentation for more information about blocks.</p>

    <h2>AJAX</h2>

    <p>Using AJAX with Ronin is quite straightforward - an AJAX request to a Ronin URL is handled like any other
      request. Ronin view templates can render XML or JSON (or any other data format) instead of HTML, so they can be
      used for responding to AJAX calls.</p>

    <p>If you're using AJAX to dynamically refresh some subsection of a page, here's an elegant way of doing so. Define
      a controller method which is responsible for rendering the section of the page you'd like to refresh. From the
      view template for the main page, insert a Gosu snippet which calls that method in the place where that section
      goes, and it will render the initial contents of the section. Point the AJAX call for the refresh at the URL for
      the method, and you'll get back the new HTML for the section.</p>
